### Customer Segmentation Model
- **Clusters Identified**: The unsupervised learning model identified four optimal clusters based on customer demographics and purchasing behavior (see Figure 13), as suggested by the elbow method (see Figure 12). Each cluster represents a distinct segment of the customer base, characterized by age groups and product category preferences:

- #### **Cluster 0**: Older Age Groups (51-87 years)
    - **Interests**: This cluster shows a pronounced preference for beauty and personal care products, along with home products. These interests may reflect a focus on self-care, maintenance, and comfort, characteristics often valued by this demographic.
    - **Behavioral Insights**: Customers in this age range might be more brand loyal and less price-sensitive compared to other segments. They might prefer purchasing products that ensure quality and reliability, which suggests an opportunity for upselling higher-end or premium products.
    - **Marketing Strategy**: Tailored marketing for this group could involve emphasizing product reliability, comfort, and health benefits. Marketing channels such as traditional media (TV, radio) and print (magazines, newspapers) could be effective alongside targeted online campaigns.
    - **Product Development**: Products that cater to ease of use, ergonomics, and health benefits (e.g., skincare products for sensitive skin, ergonomic home tools) could be particularly appealing to this segment.

- #### **Cluster 1**: Middle-Aged Groups (31-50 years)
    - **Interests**: Customers in this cluster focus on home and food products. This interest might be driven by their lifestyle, possibly balancing family life and career, which emphasizes the need for practical and time-saving solutions.
    - **Behavioral Insights**: This segment might be interested in value for money, quality, and products that offer convenience. There is likely a significant interest in online shopping platforms that provide quick delivery options.
    - **Marketing Strategy**: Engaging this segment might involve campaigns highlighting product efficiency, family benefits, and cost-effectiveness. Promotions during back-to-school seasons or major holidays could be particularly effective.
    - **Product Development**: Consider developing multi-functional or eco-friendly products that cater to a home-centric lifestyle, or meal kits and other food products that save time while offering nutritional benefits.

- #### **Cluster 2**: Younger Adults (21-40 years)
    - **Interests**: This demographic shows a strong inclination towards electronics and food, indicating a blend of tech-savviness and a fast-paced lifestyle. They are likely to be early adopters of new technology and value convenience in meal solutions.
    - **Behavioral Insights**: This group is probably more experimental and less brand loyal, driven by trends and online reviews. They may prefer shopping online and are likely influenced by influencer marketing and peer recommendations.
    - **Marketing Strategy**: Digital marketing strategies including social media campaigns, influencer partnerships, and email marketing could be particularly effective. Highlighting the latest tech features, usability, and trendy aspects of the products can capture their interest.
    - **Product Development**: Innovations in technology that integrate seamlessly with a connected lifestyle (smart home products, wearable tech) and convenient, health-oriented food products could resonate well with this segment.

- #### **Cluster 3**: The Youngest Demographic (0-30 years)
    - **Interests**: Focused on electronics and beauty/personal care products, this cluster likely values both innovation and personal image. The interest in personal care products at a younger age may also indicate a strong influence of social media on consumer habits.
    - **Behavioral Insights**: Customers in this age group are usually more price-sensitive, seeking the best value for money. They tend to be highly influenced by social media trends and are more likely to engage in online shopping.
    - **Marketing Strategy**: Leveraging trendy and visually appealing advertising on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat can be very effective. Promotions, discounts, and limited-time offers could drive quick purchasing decisions.
    - **Product Development**: Developing affordable, trendy electronics that cater to the entertainment needs of this age group, along with eco-friendly and cruelty-free beauty products, can meet the ethical and aesthetic expectations of younger consumers.


**Overlapping Age Groups**: For the model going forward, the clusters were consolidated from 4 to 3. This decision was due to overlapping age groups. Cluster 2 has age groups that overlaps with Cluster 3 and Cluster 1. This approach is to streamline the model and focus on distinct segments that exhibit unique purchasing patterns.

### Sales Prediction Model
- **Model Performance**: The evaluation of model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) shows that the Random Forest model outperformed the Linear Regression across all clusters (see Figure 22). This suggests that the Random Forest model is better at capturing the non-linear relationships and interactions between features within the dataset.
- **Cluster 1**: Young and youngest demographics show significantly improved prediction accuracy in the Random Forest model, likely due to the model's ability to handle the variability and complexities of younger consumer behavior.
- **Cluster 2**: The middle-aged segment also demonstrated better results with Random Forest, suggesting that this model is more adept at forecasting for groups with varied product interests.
- **Cluster 3**: The oldest demographic showed the most substantial improvement in prediction accuracy with Random Forest, underscoring its effectiveness in dealing with segments that may have more stable but diverse purchasing patterns.
